# Java-Fundamentals
UDEMY - Complete Java SE 8 Developer Bootcamp
Each lab exercise worked upon the original code.

--------- LAB EXERCISES ---------

CREATING CLASSES 
- Create a reusable object type(class) called MyDate
- Add attibutes to the MyDate class
- Add multiple constructors to the MyDate class
- Add methods to the MyDate class
- Test my definition of the MyDate class with a test class
- Explorse an initialization block in MyDate

STATIC
- Explore a prewritten class or type called Order
- Add a static variable to an Order class
- Add several static methods to Order
- Add an instance method to use the static data in Order
- Optionally add a static initialization block
- Optionally explore an additional constructor on Order and the use of the this keyword.

PACKAGING
- Create three packages
- Move existing code to these packages
- See the use of package and import statements in the code
- Begin to explore the effect of packaging on access to data and methods in classes
- Optionally build a Java archive (JAR) of your existing code.

PRIMITIVES
- Declare a number of primitive type references (local variables).
- Explore implicit upcast between primitive types.
- Use cast operator in downcast situations.
- Use comments to include/exclude code from compiling/executing.
- Revisit static variables.
- Optionally learn how to replace some primitives with big number objects.

SYNTAX
- Use conditionals to return an appropriate value from a method
- Use a switch statement to guide calculations appropriately
- Use one of Java’s loops to iterate over a series of numbers
- Explore the use of arithmetic operators with Java primitives

PARAMETER PASSING
- Pass a MyDate object, integer primitive, and String object to separate modifying methods to see how they are affected
- See some additional String methods and operators
- Optionally explore the StringBuffer class and how it behaves when passed to a method

ENCAPSULATION
- Encapsulate the fields of your application classes
- See how an IDE can help to encapsulate data
- Understand the importance of encapsulation and how it can help isolate later code changes

INHERITANCE 
- Create a hierarchy of product types using inheritance
- Use “super” to chain constructors in the class hierarchy
- Explore overriding of super class methods
- See a public static final constant on one of Java’s classes
- Optionally look at a “final” method

POLYMORPHISM
- Update the Order type to use polymorphism and the good type hierarchy (Good, Liquid, Solid) for products, rather than using a string
- Update MyDate to override the polymorphic equals( ) method from java.lang.Object.
- Optionally explore the cast operation to cast a general reference back to a more specific type of object.

ABSTRACT INTERFACE
- Modify the Good class to be abstract
- Create an interface that generically describes a good or service
- Use polymorphism with interfaces to allow Order objects to be associated with either a good or a service
- Optionally use static imports to simplify code

LAMBDA
- Create a functional interface
- Implement a lambda expression

DATE TIME
- Create a lambda
- Instantiate LocalDate objects
- Use LocalDate methods to compare one to another.

ARRAYS
- Create and initialize an array
- Learn how to add elements to an array
- Explore how to iterate through an array with a for loop

COLLECTIONS
- Create and initialize an ArrayList
- Optionally create and initialize a HashSet
- Learn how to add, remove, and retrieve elements from a collection
- Explore how to iterate through a collection with Iterator
- Once again observe the power of polymorphism through a heterogeneous collection

MORE WITH COLLECTIONS
- Use generics to type your collection instances.
- Sort the catalog of goods.
- Optionally try out other collection operations, like search, on your catalog of goods.

EXCEPTIONS
- Create an exception class and use it to create an exception object
- See how to throw the exception object when the application detects a problem or potential problem
- Learn how to use try-catch blocks to capture and react to problems
- Learn how to rethrow an exception as another way to handle an exception
